[Full Changelog](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/compare/0.9.5...1.0.0)

In this release, there are a couple of new features. Also, Restic itself has not been updated in a while. So it makes sense to switch to our own versioning scheme now. In order to indicate this change, we are now continuing with 1.0.0.

The new version does not indicate any kind of stability or feature freeze. It is just a new numbering scheme which is now uncoupled from the Restic version in use.

- Post commands [\#8](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/pull/8) ([nikkoura](https://github.com/nikkoura))
- Support `rclone` [\#6](https://github.com/djmaze/resticker/pull/6) ([maximbaz](https://github.com/maximbaz))
