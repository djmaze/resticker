# Resticker

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/mazzolino/restic.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/mazzolino/restic/)
[![Build status](https://ci.strahlungsfrei.de/api/badges/djmaze/resticker/status.svg)](https://ci.strahlungsfrei.de/djmaze/resticker)

Run automatic [restic](https://restic.github.io/) backups via a Docker container.

## Features

- run scheduled backups
- backup to any (local or remote) target supported by restic
- support for tags, exclude definitions, and all other optional restic options
- automatic forgetting of old backups
- prune backups on a schedule
- remove a stale repository lock
- can be used as a (global) Docker swarm service in order to backup every cluster node
- multi-arch: the image `mazzolino/restic` runs on `amd64` as well as `armv7` (for now)

## Usage

Use the supplied example configs to set up a backup schedule.

The Compose files contain a _backup_ and a _prune_ service which can be scheduled independently of each other. Feel free to remove the _prune_ service if you want to run the prune jobs manually.

### With Docker Compose

Adjust the supplied [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.example.yml) as needed. Then run:

    docker-compose up -d

### With Docker Swarm mode

Adjust the supplied [docker-swarm.yml](docker-swarm.example.yml) as needed. Then deploy it as a stack:

    docker stack deploy -f docker-swarm.yml backup

### Versioning scheme

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The docker images (under [`mazzolino/restic`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mazzolino/restic/)) are tagged accordingly:

- `latest` - built from the latest `master` commit
- `1.6.0` - one tag for each patch release
- `1.6`, `1` - points to the latest patch release below that minor / major version (in this case `1.6.0`)

It is recommended to pin to the latest patch version (e.g. `1.6.0`) and update the version manually (or using an automated process like [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/)).

Look at the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) or Github releases to find the latest version.

Also, an image will be generated for each pull request. The tags are labeled `pr-xxx` where `xxx` is the id of the pull request.

### Restoring

In order to restore files on a host where the container is already running via Docker Compose, you can use `exec`:

```bash
# Find the latest snapshot for the current host (note the ID)
docker-compose exec app restic snapshots -H <HOSTNAME>
# Restore the given file on the host
docker-compose exec app restic restore --include /path/to/file <ID>
```

When using Swarm mode, you need to manually SSH into the host and run `docker exec -it ..` accordingly.

### Advanced usage

You can use the same config to run any restic command with the given configuration.

When using the Docker Compose setup:

    docker-compose run --rm app <RESTIC ARGS>

E.g.

    docker-compose run --rm app snapshots

When given the `unlock` command, the repository check will be skipped (because it will fail on a locked repository either way).

## Configuration options

_Note: `BACKUP_CRON`, `PRUNE_CRON` and `CHECK_CRON` are mutually exclusive._

- `BACKUP_CRON` - A cron expression for when to run the backup. E.g. `0 30 3 * * *` in order to run every night at 3:30 am. See [the go-cron documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron) for details on the expression format (a [customized go-cron](https://github.com/djmaze/go-cron/) is used which allows the definition of seconds as first parameter).
- `PRUNE_CRON` - A cron expression for when to run the prune job. E.g. `0 0 4 * * *` in order to run every night at 4:00 am. See [the go-cron documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron) for details on the expression format (a [customized go-cron](https://github.com/djmaze/go-cron/) is used which allows the definition of seconds as first parameter).
- `CHECK_CRON` - A cron expression for when to run the check job. E.g. `0 15 5 * * *` in order to run every night at 5:15 am. See [the go-cron documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron) for details on the expression format (a [customized go-cron](https://github.com/djmaze/go-cron/) is used which allows the definition of seconds as first parameter).
- `RUN_ON_STARTUP` - Set to `"true"` to execute a backup or prune job right on startup, in addition to the given cron expression. Disabled by default
- `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` - Location of the restic repository. You can use [any target supported by restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html). Default `/mnt/restic`
- `RESTIC_BACKUP_SOURCES` - Source directory to backup. Make sure to mount this into the container as a volume (see the example configs). Default `/data`
- `RESTIC_PASSWORD` - Password for the restic repository. Will also be used to initialize the repository if it is not yet initialized
- `RESTIC_BACKUP_ARGS` - If specified `restic backup` is run with the given arguments, e.g. for tags, exclude definitions, or verbose logging: `--tag docker-volumes --exclude-file exclude.txt --verbose`. Make sure **not** to use the `=` form of assignment, but use spaces between parameter and value, and escape spaces using backslash (`\`). See the [restic backup documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/040_backup.html) for available options and [docker-compose.example.yml](docker-compose.example.yml) for an adjusted example.
- `RESTIC_BACKUP_TAGS` - _Deprecated_. Tags to set for each snapshot, separated by commas. This option will soon be removed. Please use `RESTIC_BACKUP_ARGS` to define tags.
- `RESTIC_FORGET_ARGS` - If specified `restic forget` is run with the given arguments after each backup or before every prune, e.g. `--prune --keep-last 14 --keep-daily 1`. See the [restic forget documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/060_forget.html) for available options
- `RESTIC_PRUNE_ARGS` - If specified `restic prune` is run with the given arguments, e.g. for B2 concurrent connection settings and verbose logging: `-o b2.connections=10 --verbose`.
- `RESTIC_CHECK_ARGS` - If specified `restic check` is run with the given arguments, e.g. `--read-data-subset=10%` to check a randomly choosen subset (10%) of the repository pack files. Without option, only the structure of the repository is checked. The option `--read-data-subset` will also check data, at the cost of transfering them from the repository.; e.g. for B2 concurrent connection settings and verbose logging: `-o b2.connections=10 --verbose`.
- (Additional variables as needed for the chosen backup target. E.g. `B2_ACCOUNT_ID` and `B2_ACCOUNT_KEY` for Backblaze B2. See official restic documentation about [supported environment variables](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/040_backup.html#environment-variables).)
- `TZ` - Optional. Set your timezone for the correct cron execution time.

### Using the `rclone` repository type

In order to use the `rclone` repository type, you need to prepare an `rclone.conf` file and mount it inside the container at `/run/secrets/rclone.conf`.

So when in swarm mode, you can just use `rclone.conf` as a _Docker secret_.

Example for Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  backup:
    # ...
    volumes:
      - ./rclone.conf:/run/secrets/rclone.conf:ro
```

Example for Docker swarm mode:

```yaml
services:
  backup:
    # ...
    secrets:
      - rclone.conf

secrets:
  rclone.conf:
    file: ./rclone.conf
```

#### Note for backends with token-based access

If you are using rclone backends which make use of oauth refresh tokens (B2, OneDrive, Google) the `rclone.conf` needs to be writable inside the container. That means you need to directly mount a *directory* (r/w) which contains the config file to the final config directory inside the container.

Example for Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  backup:
    # ...
    volumes:
      - ./rclone:/root/.config/rclone
```

Where `./rclone` should be a local directory which contains your `rclone.conf`.

### Using `sftp` repository type

In order to use the `sftp` repository type, you need to prepare a `.ssh` directory with your private ssh key(s), `known_hosts` (and an optional `config` file) and mount it inside the container at `/run/secrets/.ssh`.

Example for Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  backup:
    # ...
    volumes:
      - ./.ssh:/run/secrets/.ssh:ro
```

## Using `restic mount`

If you want to mount your backup repository *inside the container* using `restic mount`, you need to [give the container SYS_ADMIN privilege and allow the fuse device](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49021109).

Example for Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  backup:
    # ...
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse
```

Also the fuse kernel module should be loaded (`modprobe fuse`).

## Execute commands prior to backup

It's possible to optionally execute commands (like database dumps, or stopping a running container to avoid inconsistent backup data) before the actual backup starts. If you want to execute `docker` commands on the host, mount the Docker socket to the container. To do that add the following volume to the compose or swarm configuration:

    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

You can add one or multiple commands by specifying the following environment variable:

    PRE_COMMANDS: |-
                docker exec nextcloud-postgres pg_dumpall -U nextcloud -f /data/nextcloud.sql
                docker exec other-postgres pg_dumpall -U other -f /data/other.sql
                docker stop my_container

The commands specified in `PRE_COMMANDS` are executed one by one.

## Execute commands after backup

It's possible to optionally execute commands (like restarting a temporarily stopped container, send a mail...) once the actual backup has finished. Like for pre-backup commands, if you want to execute `docker` commands on the host, mount the Docker socket to the container.

You can add one or multiple commands by specifying the following environment variables:

    POST_COMMANDS_SUCCESS: |-
    	/my/scripts/mail-success.sh

    POST_COMMANDS_FAILURE: |-
    	/my/scripts/mail-failure.sh

    POST_COMMANDS_INCOMPLETE: |-
    	/my/scripts/mail-incomplete.sh

    POST_COMMANDS_EXIT: |-
    	docker start my_container

The commands specified are executed one by one.

- `POST_COMMANDS_SUCCESS` commands will be executed after a fully successful backup run (i.e. all files could be read).
- `POST_COMMANDS_FAILURE` commands will be executed after a failed backup run.
- `POST_COMMANDS_INCOMPLETE` commands will be executed if the backup is incomplete (i.e. one or more files could not be read).
- `POST_COMMANDS_EXIT` will always be executed, after both successful or failed backup runs.

By default, when any file could not be backed up, the commands from `POST_COMMANDS_FAILURE` will be executed. When `SUCCESS_ON_INCOMPLETE_BACKUP` is set to `"true"`, the commands from `POST_COMMANDS_INCOMPLETE` will be executed instead. Unless those are not configured – then the commands from `POST_COMMANDS_SUCCESS` will be executed.

### Notification example

The Resticker docker image does not contain any tools for sending notifications, apart from `curl`. You should thus connect a second container for that purpose. For example, this is how mail notifications can be sent using [apprise-microservice](https://github.com/djmaze/apprise-microservice):

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: mazzolino/restic:1.1
    environment:
      # ...
      POST_COMMANDS_FAILURE: |-
        curl -X POST --data "{\"title\": \"Backup failed\", \"body\": \"\"}" http://notify:5000
    networks:
      - notification

  notify:
    image: mazzolino/apprise-microservice:0.1
    environment:
      NOTIFICATION_URLS: mailto://...
    networks:
      - notification

networks:
  notification:
```

## Build instructions

Use the supplied [Makefile](Makefile) in order to build your own image:

    make image IMAGE=myuser/restic

You can also push images and build on a different architecture:

    make image IMAGE=myuser/restic ARCH=arm

For more targets, see the Makefile.

## Testing

There are automated tests for the scripts running in the container. You need to install [shellspec](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec/) to run them.

The test suite can be executed by running the following in the resticker source directory:

```bash
shellspec
```

This will build the image, create a container and run the tests inside the container.
